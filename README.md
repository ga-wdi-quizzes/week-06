# Week 06

### Question 1

You're working on your Tunr app and you encounter this error. What does it mean and where would you go first to address it?  

![Rails error](http://i.imgur.com/9NR7XNT.png)  

```
This means that rails can't access the needed file for the artists/index path/view.  There needs to be an index.html.erb file in the view/artists/index/ directory.  So, first, you'd go check out the view/artists/index/ directory.
```

### Question 2

Consider this file name:

```
20150726145027_create_artists.rb
```

What is the purpose of this file, and what is the purpose of the numbers at the beginning of its name?

```This is a migration file.  A migration file contains instructions to fill a database schema.  Rails uses these files to add/remove tables, columns, entries, etc in the database's schema.The numbers at the beginning are a timestamp.
```

### Question 3

In a Rails application, how is the router related to controller actions?  

```
the rails router recognizes urls and sends their request info to the controller.  Controllers define an action or code to execute according to what kind of request the router gets.  The router can also generate paths and urls for controllers to use.
```

### Question 4

Assuming our Tunr Rails app (1) has a Song model that belongs to an Artist model and (2) uses nested resources, which of the following helpers would create a URL that routes to `songs#new`? (Select one answer)  

```
[] artist_song_path( @artist, @song )
[] new_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] create_artist_song_path( @artist )
[x] new_artist_song_path( @artist, Song.all )
[] new_song_path( @song )
```

### Question 5

Where are (a) cookies and (b) session variables stored? (Select one answer)  

```
[] (a) Server, (b) Browser  
[] (a) Browser, (b) Database  
[] (a) Database, (b) Server  
[x] (a) Browser, (b) Server  
```

### Question 6

Assume each Song in Tunr has an `avg_rating` attribute. It is an integer from 1 to 10, and is the average rating of all of Tunr's millions of enthusiastic users.

You would like the title of each song to be displayed in a different color depending on the song's rating.

A great song like "Livin' on a Prayer" would have a rating of 10 and appear green, and a bad song like "Blurred Lines" would have a rating of 1 and appear red.

Without getting into specifics of how you would write the code itself, pick one and defend your answer:

This code would make most sense as a...
- ...model method.
- ...controller method.
- ...helper method.

```text
This would make most sense as a helper method because the color coding is crucial for the html rendering and helper methods are methods defined in a controller and made available to be used in views.   
```

### Question 7

You clone yet another Tunr repo. Put the following commands in the correct order necessary to make the app run. Delete the one command that will not be used.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
$ bundle install
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
```

### Question 8

You're a good person and decide to validate your HTML. You copy and paste the contents of `app/views/artists/index.html.erb` into the validator:

```erb
<h2>Artists</h2>

<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <div><%= link_to artist.name, artist %></div>
<% end %>
```

The validator throws errors at you! Why? Assuming you haven't made any mistakes in your code, how could you go about accurately validating your HTML?

```
The second argument for link_to needs to be artist_path.
```

### Question 9

What are two differences between the two following commands?

```
$ rails new tunr
$ rails new . -d postgresql
```

```
the first starts a rails app directory called tunr.  The second creates rails app files within the terminal user's working directory and specifies postgresql as the kind of database that's going to be used.
```

### Question 10

Which **one** of the following is the most correct way to display an error message to the user?

```rb
[] @error = "Wrong password!"
[] puts "Wrong password!"
[x] flash[:alert] = "Wrong password!"
[] session[:error] = "Wrong password!"
[] render error: "Wrong password!"
[] flash[:notice] = "Wrong password!"
```

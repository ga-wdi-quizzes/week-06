# Week 06

### Question 1

You're working on your Tunr app and you encounter this error. What does it mean and where would you go first to address it?  

![Rails error](http://i.imgur.com/9NR7XNT.png)  

```text
It is showing that there is no index view(template) file exist. I would create index.html.rb file under the views/artists folder.

```

### Question 2

Consider this file name:

```
20150726145027_create_artists.rb
```

What is the purpose of this file, and what is the purpose of the numbers at the beginning of its name?

```text
It is migration file that has methods which model can have an access data from the database through active record.

```

### Question 3

In a Rails application, how is the router related to controller actions?  

```text
Router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. Controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which requests.

```

### Question 4

Assuming our Tunr Rails app (1) has a Song model that belongs to an Artist model and (2) uses nested resources, which of the following helpers would create a URL that routes to `songs#new`? (Select one answer)  

```
[] artist_song_path( @artist, @song )
[x] new_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] create_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] new_artist_song_path( @artist, Song.all )
[] new_song_path( @song )
```

### Question 5

Where are (a) cookies and (b) session variables stored? (Select one answer)  

```
[] (a) Server, (b) Browser  
[] (a) Browser, (b) Database  
[] (a) Database, (b) Server  
[x] (a) Browser, (b) Server  
```

### Question 6

Assume each Song in Tunr has an `avg_rating` attribute. It is an integer from 1 to 10, and is the average rating of all of Tunr's millions of enthusiastic users.

You would like the title of each song to be displayed in a different color depending on the song's rating.

A great song like "Livin' on a Prayer" would have a rating of 10 and appear green, and a bad song like "Blurred Lines" would have a rating of 1 and appear red.

Without getting into specifics of how you would write the code itself, pick one and defend your answer:

This code would make most sense as a...
- ...model method.
- ...controller method.
- ...helper method.

```text
...controller method.
```

### Question 7

You clone yet another Tunr repo. Put the following commands in the correct order necessary to make the app run. Delete the one command that will not be used.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
$ bundle install
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s

Delete $ rails new . -d postgresql since we are cloning the app.(This was my slack question...^^)

```

### Question 8

You're a good person and decide to validate your HTML. You copy and paste the contents of `app/views/artists/index.html.erb` into the validator:

```erb
<h2>Artists</h2>

<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <div><%= link_to artist.name, artist %></div>
<% end %>
```

The validator throws errors at you! Why? Assuming you haven't made any mistakes in your code, how could you go about accurately validating your HTML?

```
The HTML validator can't read embedded ruby file. You can upload your app on the web browser, and right click to see the view page source from there. You can copy and paste html code from there to HTML validator to validate the code.

```

### Question 9

What are two differences between the two following commands?

```
$ rails new tunr
$ rails new . -d postgresql
```

```
$ rails new tunr
this will create new tunr app and connects your app with Mysql which is rails default database system.

$ rails new . -d postgresql
this will create new rails app in the current folder connect with postgresql as a default database.



```

### Question 10

Which **one** of the following is the most correct way to display an error message to the user?

```rb
[] @error = "Wrong password!"
[] puts "Wrong password!"
[x] flash[:alert] = "Wrong password!"
[] session[:error] = "Wrong password!"
[] render error: "Wrong password!"
[] flash[:notice] = "Wrong password!"
```

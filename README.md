# Week 06

### Question 1

You're working on your Tunr app and you encounter this error. What does it mean and where would you go first to address it?

```text
Your answer...
you need to create a view (index.html.erb) for artists index
```

### Question 2

Consider this file name:

```
20150726145027_create_artists.rb
```

What is the purpose of this file, and what is the purpose of the numbers at the beginning of its name?

```text
Your answer...
this file is a migration file - it contains the layout for the table (in the database). the numbers denote a time stamp for when it was created
```

### Question 3

In a Rails application, how is the router related to controller actions?  

```text
Your answer...
if a request to some application is recognized in the router, the router will send the request to the controller, which then performs the necessary action. if the router does not recognize the request, it will error out
```

### Question 4

Assuming our Tunr Rails app (1) has a Song model that belongs to an Artist model and (2) uses nested resources, which of the following helpers would create a URL that routes to `songs#new`? (Select one answer)  

```
[] artist_song_path( @artist, @song )
[x] new_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] create_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] new_artist_song_path( @artist, Song.all )
[] new_song_path( @song )
```

### Question 5

Where are (a) cookies and (b) session variables stored? (Select one answer)  

```
[] (a) Server, (b) Browser  
[] (a) Browser, (b) Database  
[] (a) Database, (b) Server  
[x] (a) Browser, (b) Server  
```

### Question 6

Assume each Song in Tunr has an `avg_rating` attribute. It is an integer from 1 to 10, and is the average rating of all of Tunr's millions of enthusiastic users.

You would like the title of each song to be displayed in a different color depending on the song's rating.

A great song like "Livin' on a Prayer" would have a rating of 10 and appear green, and a bad song like "Blurred Lines" would have a rating of 1 and appear red.

Without getting into specifics of how you would write the code itself, pick one and defend your answer:

This code would make most sense as a...
- ...model method.
- ...controller method.
- ...helper method.

```text
Your answer...
model method
Ideally, one should aim to have fat models and skinny controllers, and the logic behind which song should be which color depending on the rating can all be done in the model.
```

### Question 7

You clone yet another Tunr repo. Put the following commands in the correct order necessary to make the app run. Delete the one command that will not be used.

```
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rails new . -d postgresql
$ bundle install
$ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails s
$ rake db:seed
```
````
1. $ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
2. $ bundle install
3. $ rake db:drop
4. $ rake db:create
5. $ rake db:migrate
6. $ rake db:seed
7. $ rails s
````


### Question 8

You're a good person and decide to validate your HTML. You copy and paste the contents of `app/views/artists/index.html.erb` into the validator:

```erb
<h2>Artists</h2>

<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <div><%= link_to artist.name, artist %></div>
<% end %>
```

The validator throws errors at you! Why? Assuming you haven't made any mistakes in your code, how could you go about accurately validating your HTML?

```
Your answer...
see if it works on your page ?
```

### Question 9

What are two differences between the two following commands?

```
$ rails new tunr
$ rails new . -d postgresql
```

```
Your answer...
rails new tunr makes a completely new rails app without specifying that we want to use postgresql - i think the default might be MySQL.
the second command creates a all the rails app folders within the directory that you already have (denoted by the . ). also it specifies that we want to use postgresql
```

### Question 10

Which **one** of the following is the most correct way to display an error message to the user?

```rb
[] @error = "Wrong password!"
[] puts "Wrong password!"
[x] flash[:alert] = "Wrong password!"
[] session[:error] = "Wrong password!"
[] render error: "Wrong password!"
[] flash[:notice] = "Wrong password!"
```

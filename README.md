# Week 06

### Question 1

You're working on your Tunr app and you encounter this error. What does it mean and where would you go first to address it?  

![Rails error](http://i.imgur.com/9NR7XNT.png)  

```
The first part of an error message identifies what template is missing. The second part part of the message contains a hash and the last part of this message tells us where Rails has looked for the templates.
The error message here is saying you are missing a template aka you are missing the page artist.index.html.erb

When in doubt. GOOGLE!!!!!

```

### Question 2

Consider this file name:

```
20150726145027_create_artists.rb
```

What is the purpose of this file, and what is the purpose of the numbers at the beginning of its name?

```text
It is a migration file. It is used to create the artist table in the database. The numbers in the beginning represent when the migration file was created. The timestamp tells the computer in what order to run the migrates.
```

### Question 3

In a Rails application, how is the router related to controller actions?  

```
Within a route, a controller & action is specified. For example,  and an action   in  "artists#new", the right indicates the artists controller and the ac its specifying that there is a new artists being added. Thus it would go to the artist.new.html.erb.
```

### Question 4

Assuming our Tunr Rails app (1) has a Song model that belongs to an Artist model and (2) uses nested resources, which of the following helpers would create a URL that routes to `songs#new`? (Select one answer)  

```
[] artist_song_path( @artist, @song )
[X] new_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] create_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] new_artist_song_path( @artist, Song.all )
[] new_song_path( @song )
```

### Question 5

Where are (a) cookies and (b) session variables stored? (Select one answer)  

```
[] (a) Server, (b) Browser  
[] (a) Browser, (b) Database  
[] (a) Database, (b) Server  
[X] (a) Browser, (b) Server  
```

### Question 6

Assume each Song in Tunr has an `avg_rating` attribute. It is an integer from 1 to 10, and is the average rating of all of Tunr's millions of enthusiastic users.

You would like the title of each song to be displayed in a different color depending on the song's rating.

A great song like "Livin' on a Prayer" would have a rating of 10 and appear green, and a bad song like "Blurred Lines" would have a rating of 1 and appear red.

Without getting into specifics of how you would write the code itself, pick one and defend your answer:

This code would make most sense as a...
- ...model method.
- ...controller method.
- ...helper method.

```
From process of elmination, I would say a helper method. It is the only method that would change the visually change the format of the information. es
```

### Question 7

You clone yet another Tunr repo. Put the following commands in the correct order necessary to make the app run. Delete the one command that will not be used.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
$ bundle install
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
```

### Question 8

You're a good person and decide to validate your HTML. You copy and paste the contents of `app/views/artists/index.html.erb` into the validator:

```erb
<h2>Artists</h2>

<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <div><%= link_to artist.name, artist %></div>
<% end %>
```

The validator throws errors at you! Why? Assuming you haven't made any mistakes in your code, how could you go about accurately validating your HTML?

```
  Rails will put some ERB into the _form.html.erb that it generates that displays the full list of errors on that model.

```

### Question 9

What are two differences between the two following commands?

```
$ rails new tunr
$ rails new . -d postgresql
```

```
The first line makes the new ruby on rails file. However, there is no postgres file related to it.
The second line
```

### Question 10

Which **one** of the following is the most correct way to display an error message to the user?

```rb
[] @error = "Wrong password!"
[] puts "Wrong password!"
[X] flash[:alert] = "Wrong password!"
[] session[:error] = "Wrong password!"
[] render error: "Wrong password!"
[] flash[:notice] = "Wrong password!"
```
